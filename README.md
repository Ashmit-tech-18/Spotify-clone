# Spotify-clone
This project is a detailed front-end clone of the Spotify web player, built entirely with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript (ES6). The primary goal of this project was to replicate the core user interface and user experience of Spotify, focusing on clean code, responsive design, and dynamic interactivity
